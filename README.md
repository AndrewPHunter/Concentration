[Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Project](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001)

This project is part of the Udacity Front End Web developer nanodegree program. The goal of the project was to make a classic 16 card memory game.

## Features
This memory game features animations for card flipping, background music, a local leaderboard to store top scores and a settings page to control everything.

### How the game works
The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!
